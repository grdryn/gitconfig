= gitconfig

üìù Some common git configs / hooks / templates that I use

== Global config

The `.gitconfig` file is intended to be (at least part of) a user's
 global `~/.gitconfig`.

== Commit message template

The `.git-commit-template` is also expected to live in the user's home
 directory. If you wish to change its name or location on your own
 system, you'll just need to update the `commit.template` property in
 the global template. In essence, link:.gitconfig#L73[here].

The main purpose of the commit message template is to make it easier
 for me to use https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/[gitmoji] with my
 current tooling, rather than installing
 https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli[gitmoji-cli] (which is
 also cool if you want to use that).

When I'm committing with magit (emacs üíñ), and I'm presented with the
 template, I'll just uncomment the most relevant emoji summary line,
 and modify the message to be specific to my commit. I imagine it
 should work similarly with whatever tools you use.

== prepare-commit-msg hook

The `prepare-commit-msg` hook should be symlinked/copied into the
`.git/hooks` directory within each repo that you intend to use it for.

There are a couple of things that it does currently:

. If it's a merge commit, it will prefix the summary line with üîÄ,
 because emoji are the future, and this is the one that
 https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/[gitmoji] prescribes for merging
 branches. üòé

. If http://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[GitPython] is
 installed, and the current branch name starts with either `RHMAP-` or
 `FH-`, then it will uncomment the `JIRA_PLACEHOLDER` line in the commit
 message template, and insert a link to the issue on issues.jboss.org.

== Contributing

You want to make this even more awesome? That's great! You can open a
 PR on Github (or any other repo hosting site that you may find this
 hosted), or email changes to me. Consider including a relevant
 gitmoji in the commit message!

If you fork and make your own custom changes but don't want to bother
 proposing those changes back to the original repo
 (https://github.com/grdryn/gitconfig), that's cool too; just consider
 sending me a link anyway so that I can see what cool things you're
 doing. üòâ
